#### By Shanen Cross

## Technologies Used

* .NET SDK
* MSTest

## Description

A learning project for the Epicodus coding school, made to practice C# and MSTEST. Determine a person's allergies given the input of their "allergy score", which is a sum of the allergen scores of that person's allergies. 

| allergen    | score |
| ----------- | ----- |
| eggs        | 1     |
| peanuts     | 2     |
| shellfish   | 4     |
| strawberries| 8     |
| tomatoes    | 16    |
| chocolate   | 32    |
| pollen      | 64    |
| cats        | 128   |

In fact, these allergen scores are powers of two, so this is a hidden way of practicing converting a number into binary.
